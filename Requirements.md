We feel it is important that your cats stay on their own diet, so we ask that you provide the food as well as feeding instructions.  If your cat requires medication, there is a small fee to administer it.  All cats must be current on vaccines and in good health.  We require Rabies, FVRCP and should be given a minimum of 2 weeks prior to their stay.  We are a flea free environment and ask that your cats are on a flea regimen for their stay.  We do check before boarding, any evidence of fleas at the time of boarding will result in a cancellation of stay.  If your cat becomes soiled while traveling to our facility and requires a bath, we are happy to take care of that for a minimal charge.  Please email or bring copies of proof of vaccines as well as flea treatment for your stay.
